    <p>CoyIM is a standalone chat client that focuses on safety and security. It is a self contained program that runs on Windows, Linux and OS X. CoyIM only supports one chat protocol - XMPP (sometimes known as Jabber). CoyIM has carefully picked and chose the features that are necessary to create a good chat experience, while keeping the attack surface of the system to a minimum.</p>

    <p>It also has built in support for Tor, OTR and TLS. The Tor support allows users to become anonymous while chatting. OTR makes end-to-end encryption of communication possible. And TLS adds another layer of encryption to the communication with the chat servers. These feautures are not plugins or extras in any way.</p>

    <p>CoyIM is implemented in Go. Many other implementation languages open up the door for a large number of attacks. We try to minimize those risks by using Go.</p>
