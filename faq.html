      <label for="toggle_2"><h3>Why is this better than other apps?</h3></label>
        <div id="expand_2">
          <p>CoyIM is designed to be safe from the moment you start it up. It is possible to just start using the application and everything will be done the right way. In some cases you can turn off the safe defaults, but you will not have to configure anything extra to get all the protection we can give you.</p>
