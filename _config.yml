    CoyIM is a new client for the XMPP protocol. It is built upon xmpp-client. It adds a graphical user interface and tries to be safe and secure by default. Our ambition is that it should be possible for even the most high-risk people on the planet to safely use CoyIM, without having to make any configuration changes.
