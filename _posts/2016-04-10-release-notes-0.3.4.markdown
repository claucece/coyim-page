# Release notes for CoyIM 0.3.4

We are very proud to release CoyIM 0.3.4!

This is a special double release day, in order to solve a specific urgent bug with OTR and resource integration. No private material would have been exposed, but conversations would have been tricky to get started and working.

New features:

- Make it possible to configure whether empty groups should be displayed or not

Bug fixes:

- \#288 - When removing a group association, that should actually be visible in the UI
- \#318 - Only set urgency hint when new messages have come in
- Fix the OS X build
