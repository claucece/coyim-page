    <p>CoyIM is a new chat client for the Jabber/XMPP protocol. On the surface, CoyIM looks a lot like other chat clients such as Pidgin, Adium and Gajim. However, under the hood, things are a bit different. The most important guiding principle for CoyIM is to create a program that is safe and secure by default - no settings to change, no plugins to install, no computer configuration to change. We want CoyIM to make it easy to be safe whatever your threat model is - even for the most high risk people on the planet.</p>
 
    <p>CoyIM is still a very young project - we started in October 2015, basing the project on Adam Langley's <a href="https://github.com/agl/xmpp-client">xmpp-client</a> for Golang. Thus, there are many features missing you might expect to be there. We aim to add most of these, although some features we will never add since they go against our goals of a small and safe client.</p>
